        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pho is a popular Vietnamese noodle soup characterized by a rich, aromatic broth, 
            flat rice noodles, and thinly sliced meat (usually beef or chicken). The broth 
            is simmered for hours with spices like star anise, cinnamon, and cloves, and it 
            is often served with a variety of fresh garnishes such as bean sprouts, basil, 
            and lime for a balanced and customizable meal.
        </p>
        <p>Making pho involves preparing an aromatic broth, cooking the noodles, thinly 
            slicing raw meat, and arranging fresh garnishes. The hot broth is then poured
            over the raw beef in the serving bowl, which cooks it instantly.

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare and Flavor the Broth</strong>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Char aromatics:</strong> Place the onion halves and ginger pieces on a baking sheet and 
                        broil on high for 8-10 minutes, until lightly charred. You can also do this over an open flame 
                        on a gas stove or in a dry pan.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Toast spices:</strong> In a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat, toast the star anise, 
                        cinnamon stick, cloves, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds until fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Simmer the broth:</strong> Add the charred onion and ginger, beef stock, water, fish sauce, and sugar 
                        to the pot. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 30 minutes
                         to infuse the flavors. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer and discard the solids 
                         before serving. Season to taste with additional salt, fish sauce, or sugar if needed. Keep the 
                         broth very hot, just below a boil.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <p></p>
        
            <li><strong>Prepare Noodles and Toppings</strong>
                <P></P>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cook noodles:</strong> Cook the rice noodles according to package instructions in a 
                        separate pot of boiling water. Drain and rinse under cold water to prevent sticking, then divide
                         them among serving bowls.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Slice beef:</strong> For easier slicing, place the raw beef in the freezer for 
                        10-15 minutes to firm up. Slice it very thinly against the grain.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Arrange toppings:</strong> Arrange all the garnishes (bean sprouts, herbs, chiles, 
                        lime wedges) on a platter for guests to add to their own bowls.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Assemble and Serve</strong>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the desired amount of raw beef slices on top of the noodles in each serving bowl.</li>
                    <li>Ladle the <strong>piping hot</strong> broth over the beef and noodles, 
                        ensuring the hot liquid cooks the meat (it should turn opaque immediately).
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve immediately with the platter of toppings, hoisin sauce, and Sriracha on the side,
                         allowing everyone to customize their bowl.
                    </li>
                </ul>
