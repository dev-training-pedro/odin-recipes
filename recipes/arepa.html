        <h1>Arepa</h1>

        <p>An arepa is a round, flat bread made from ground corn that is grilled, baked, or fried. It is a staple food
             in Colombia and Venezuela and is versatile, enjoyed in different ways like a side dish or a stuffed 
             sandwich. Simple arepas can be eaten plain with cheese or butter, while more elaborate versions are sliced
              open and filled with various ingredients like shredded meats, beans, and vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>To make traditional arepas, you combine pre-cooked white cornmeal (known as masarepa, such as the P.A.N. 
            brand), warm water, and salt to form a soft, smooth dough. The patties are then cooked on a griddle or 
            skillet until golden brown on the outside and soft inside.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 cups</strong> pre-cooked white or yellow cornmeal (masarepa)</li>
            <li><strong>2 ½ cups</strong> warm water</li>
            <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> vegetable oil or butter for cooking</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In a large bowl, dissolve the salt in the warm water. Slowly 
                add the pre-cooked cornmeal, mixing constantly with your hands or a spoon. Continue mixing until 
                the ingredients are well combined and a soft, slightly moist dough forms with no lumps.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Rest the dough:</strong> Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for about 5 to 10 minutes. 
                This allows the cornmeal to hydrate properly. The final dough should be smooth and malleable, 
                not sticky or crumbly. If the edges crack when you shape it, add a little more water; if it's too wet, 
                add a little more cornmeal.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Form the arepas:</strong> Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Lightly grease your hands 
                with a little oil or water, then roll each portion into a ball. Flatten the balls into discs about 
                ½ inch thick and 3.5 to 4 inches wide. Smooth the edges with your fingers.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cook the arepas:</strong> Heat a large non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat and brush 
                lightly with oil or butter. Place the arepas in the pan (in batches, if necessary) and cook for 
                approximately 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and a crispy crust forms.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, slice the warm arepas open horizontally (like a pita pocket) 
                and fill them with your favorite ingredients. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>
