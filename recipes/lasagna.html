    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare the Sauces and Noodles</strong>
                <p></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>the meat sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and
                             cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add
                              the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a spoon. Drain excess fat. 
                              Stir in the marinara sauce and Italian seasoning. Simmer for at least 15 minutes to allow 
                              flavors to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Make the cheese mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk the egg. Stir in the ricotta 
                            cheese, 1/2 cup of the Parmesan cheese, and chopped basil until well combined. Season with salt 
                            and pepper.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagna 
                            noodles according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain the noodles 
                            and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna</strong>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
                <p>Layer the ingredients in the following order:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spread about 3/4 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of the dish.</li>
                        <li>Add a layer of 3-4 noodles, overlapping slightly if needed.</li>
                        <li>Spread about one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
                        <li>Top with about 1 cup of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
                        <li>Spoon about 1 cup of meat sauce over the cheese layer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repeat the layers two more times</strong> (noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, meat sauce),
                             using all of the ricotta mixture and most of the sauce and mozzarella.
                        </li>
                        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, 
                            and the last of the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p></p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bake and Serve</strong>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil (spray the inside of the foil with cooking spray to 
                        prevent sticking). Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Uncover and finish:</strong> Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Let the lasagna stand for at least 10-15 minutes before cutting and serving. This helps it set for cleaner slices.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
